# Introduction

This was the first assignment as part of the completion of the "Data Science for Industry" course.

The goal of the assignment was to build a working recommender system for an online wine merchant, using very raw data from the merchant. The data needed significant cleaning, and several features had to be engineered in order to make it useful.

Multiple recommender system approaches were taken, inncluding collaborative filtering, and matrix factorization.
